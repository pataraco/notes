Workflow
--------
 Don't change file permissions manually in the workspace,
 use `p4 edit $FILE`

- p4 sync $FILE(s)
- p4 edit $FILE(s)
- <hack>
- p4 add [-c $CSN] $FILE(s)  (only new files)
  (Or: p4 change; to specify changset)
- p4 delete [-c $CSN] $FILE(s)  (only files to delete)
- p4 move [-c $CSN] $FILE(s)  (only files to delete)
- p4 opened [-c $CSN]   # confirm files are added correctly
- p4 submit [-c $CSN]

Change lists
------------
- p4 edit -c $CSN $FILE
- p4 submit [-c $CSN]
- p4 submit $FILE
- p4 submit "*".tf
- p4 changes
