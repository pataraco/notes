DATA DESIRED
------------
- cpu       # CPU utilization: Time spent in the system, user, nice, idle, and related states
? curl      # Parse statistics from websites using regular expressions
- df        # Mountpoint usage (Basically the values `df(1)' delivers)
- disk      # Disk utilization: Sectors read/written, number of read/write actions, average time an IO-operation took to complete
? exec      # Values gathered by a custom program or script.
? interface # Interface traffic: Number of octets, packets and errors for each interface.
- load      # System load average over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes
- memory    # Memory utilization: Memory occupied by running processes, page cache, buffer cache and free.
- netlink   # Very detailed Linux network interface and routing statistics. You can get (detailed) information on interfaces, qdiscs, classes, and, if you can make use of it, filters
? nginx     # Collects statistics from `nginx' (speak: engine X), a HTTP and mail server/proxy.
- ntpd      # NTP daemon statistics: Local clock drift, offset to peers, etc.
- ping      # Network latency: Time to reach the default gateway or another given host.
- processes # Process counts: Number of running, sleeping, zombie, ... processes
- redis     # The redis plugin gathers information from a Redis server, including: uptime, used memory, total connections etc.
- snmp      # Read values from SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) enabled network devices such as switches, routers, thermometers, rack monitoring servers, etc. See collectd-snmp(5).

- uptime    # System uptime statistics
- users     # Users currently logged in

------
- network   # Send the data to a remote host to save the data somehow. This is useful for large setups where the data should be saved by a dedicated machine
