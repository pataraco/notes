Kubernetes (k8s) Notes
----------------------

My kubernetes notes.

Questions
----------
1) Are you ready to handle k8s release schedule?
  - major releases: 4 x year
  - minor releases: 12+ x year
  - support: N-2 ~ 9 months
2) How many clusters will you need?
  - need to be ready to expand/deploy to (N)
  - 1 cluster / team|project
3) How mature is your SDN (SW Defined Network)?
  - L7/LB

Components
----------

Master Components
-----------------
control plane. global decisions. events.

 - kube-apiserver: exposes API, scales
 - etcd: key/val store of cluster data, always backup
 - kube-scheduler: schedules newly created pods to run on specific nodes
 - controller: control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster
     through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current
     state towards the desired state.
 - kube-controller-manager: runs controllers
   - node controller: notices/responds to nodes going down
   - replication controller: maintains correct number of pods for replication
     controller objects
   - endpoints controller: populates the Endpoints object (joins Services & Pods)
   - service account & token controllers: create default accounts and API access
     tokens for new namespaces
 - cloud-controller-manager: runs controllers that interact with the underlying
     cloud providers
   - node controller: checks cloud provider it a node has been deleted in the
     cloud after it sops responding
   - route controller: set up routes in the underlying cloud infra
   - service controller: create, update, deleted cloud provider load balancers
   - volume controller: create, attach, mount volumes and interacting with the
     cloud provider to orchestrate volumes

Node Components
---------------
run on every node, maintain running pods, provide k8s runtime environment

 - kubelet: agent, makes sure that containers are running in a pod with PodSpecs
 - kube-proxy: enables the k8s service abstraction my maintaining network rules
   on the host and performing connection forwarding
 - container runtime: software responsible for running containers (docker,
   containerd, cri-o, rktlet, and any k8s CRI (container Runtime interface))

Addons
------
pods and services that implement cluster features. managed by deployments, 
replication controllers, etc.

 - extended list:
   https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

 - DNS: all k8s clusters should have cluster DNS. DNS server, serves DNS records
   for k8s services. containers started by k8s automatically include this DNS
   server in the DNS searches
   <service-name>.<namespace-name>.svc.cluster.local
 - Web UI (dashboard): general purpose, web-based UI for k8s clusters. allows
   management, troubleshooting of cluster applications and the cluster
 - Container resource monitoring: records generic time-series container metrics 
   in a central db and a UI to browse the data
 - Cluster-level Logging: saves container logs to a central log store with
   search/browsing interface

Objects
-------
persistent entities in the k8s system which represent the state of the cluster
 - which containerized apps are running and on which nodes
 - resources available to those applications
 - applications policies: restart, upgrades, fault-tolerance
 - "record of intent": k8s contantly work to ensure that create objects exist
   k8s desired state
 - use k8s API to create, modify, delete objects
 - object spec: describes desired state - characteristics
 - object status: actual state
 - required fields:
   - apiVersion: version of the k8s API using to create the object
   - kind: kind of object to create
   - metadata: data to uniquely identify the object, including a `name`, `UID`
     and `namespace`
   - spec: precise object format
   - name: client provided
   - UID: k8s system generated
   - namespace: virtual cluster backed by the same physical cluster, unique 
     objects within
   - labels/selectors: identifying attributes, organize, select
   - annotations: arbitrary, non-identifying metadata. uri's, version, etc.
   - field selectors: select resources based on the value of one or more
     resource fields (metadata.name=my_service, metadata.namespace!=default)


   Spec formats:
   - https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.14/

Architecture
------------
 - Nodes: worker machine (minion). managed by the master components.
   - status:
     - addresses: HostName, ExternlIp, InternalIp
     - condition: OutOfDisk, Ready, MemoryPressure, PIDPressure, DiskPressure, NetworkUnavailable
     - capacity: resouces available on the node: CPU, memory, max number of pods
     - info: general info, kernel version, k8s version, Docker version, O.S. name
   - not inherently created by k8s. created externally by cloud provider
   - interacting components: node controller, kubelet, kubectl
   - registration: with kubelet flag --register-node (default)
 - Master-Node communication

Containers
----------
   - Images
   - Container Environment Variables
   - Runtime Class
   - container Lifecycle Hooks

Workloads
---------
 - Pods: managed by controllers
 - Controllers:
   - ReplicaSet: maintains a stable set of replica Pods running, owner of a set
     of Pods
   - ReplicationController: ensures specified number of pod replicas are running
   - Deployments: roll out ReplicaSets, declare pods states, rollback, scale,
     pause, statuses, cleanup
     (a Deployment that configures a ReplicaSet in now the recommended way to
      set up replication)
   - StatefulSets: stable, unique network identifiers, persistent storage,
     ordered, graceful deployments and scaling, automated rolling updates
   - DaemonSet: ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod, run cluster
     storage daemon, run logs collection daemon on every node, run monitoring
     daemon on every node. one set per each type of daemon
   - Garbage Collection: deletes certain objects (dependents) that once had an
     owner, but no longer have an owner. metadata.ownerReferences
   - TTL Controller: limit the lifetime of resource objects that have finished
     execution (currently only handles jobs)
   - Jobs: creates one or more Pods and ensuers that a specified number of them
     successfully terminate
   - CronJob: create Jobs on a time-based schedule

Services, Load Balancing, Networking
------------------------------------
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/connect-applications-service

 - Services: defines a logical set of Pods and access policy determined by 
   Label Selector
 - DNS for Services and Pods
 - Connnectiong Applications with Services
 - Ingress
 - Ingress controllers
 - Network Policies
 - Adding entries to Pod /etc/hosts with HostAliases
 - ClusterIP -> NodePort -> LoadBalancer, ExternalName

Building Blocks (Primary)
-------------------------
if you can explain what each one of these do and how they build on each other,
then you'll have a good grasp of k8s:

 - Container
 - Pod
 - ReplicaSet or Controller
 - Deployment
 - Service
 - Ingress Rule

Building Blocks (Secondary)
---------------------------
 - Namespaces
 - Configmap
 - Secrets
 - Limits
 - env and envFrom
 - Node and Pod Affinity and Antiaffinity
 - Resource limits
 - Daemon Set
 - Stateful Set
 - Persistent Volume
 - Persistent Volume Claim

Labels & Selectors
------------------

Recommended Labels
------------------
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/

a common set of labels allows tools to work interoperably, describing object in
a common manner that all tools can underststand. and describe applications in a
way that can be queried

 - organized around the cnocept of an application
 - applications described with metadata
 - shared labels and annotations share a common prefix: `app.kubernetes.io`
 - labels without a prefix are private to users
 - a shared prefix ensures that shared labels do not interfere with custom user 
   labels

selector:
    component: redis

selector:
  matchLabels:
    componect: redis
  matchExpressions:
    - {key: env, operator: In, values: [prod, qa]}
    - {key: tier, operator: NotIn, values: [web]}

(operators: In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist)
